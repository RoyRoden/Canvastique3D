# Canvastique3D
 
Canvastique3D: A Windows application that breathes life into your flat sketches by projecting them onto 3D objects. Specifically crafted for fashion designers, product innovators, and visionary creatives, this tool bridges the gap between ideation and visualization. Simply mount an external webcam above your physical canvas, sketch or apply your design, and watch it seamlessly transform onto a 3D model. Dive even deeper by leveraging the power of OpenAI to generate innovative design variations—just remember to set up your OpenAI key. With Canvastique3D, conceptualizing and prototyping have never been so vivid and immediate. Design, Project, and Perfect—All in 3D!

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use an OpenAI API key, it is strongly recommended to set a usage hard limit preventing unexpected charges. This is an early version, tested on few machines and scenarios.
